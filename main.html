		In this city, a smile is currency â€” spend it wisely, or you'll be bankrupt in public opinion. 

       They don't remember the kindness, only the headlines. That's how stories become monuments or graves. 

       Success is a contract you sign with both hands. Fine print is where your soul lives.
